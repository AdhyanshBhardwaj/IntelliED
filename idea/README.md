## Description

**IntelliED is a mobile-based software solution that will provide easy data management and real-time analytics to 1 miilion K-12 schools and higher education instituions across India, therefore, enabling educators to leverage a data-driven approach to improve learning outcomes and equitably accelerate growth for all learners.**

## Why do we need this solution?
- Schools generate large sums of data from which they can extract insights to make smarter learning decisions and improve student outcomes.

- Researches from acclaimed institutions point out that using data analytics in education can improve the education process by helping teachers and learners make smarter decisions earlier in the learning progression and that the schools using digital tools have better overall student performance.

- Currently, schools have their data disintegrated, soiled under various sources due to which creating reports for a large number of students, analysing them, and providing precise feedback with personalized learning plans becomes a complex and time-consuming task for educators.

- Resources and infrastructure required to gather and utilize data to improve learning outcomes remains limited to elite urban schools. Hence, majority of schools are unable to leverage data to improve learning outcomes.

*Hence, we want to provide schools with IntelliED, an easy to use and cost-effective digital solution that allows them to effectively manage students’ data and extract insights from it to improve learning outcomes for students.*

## What is the solution and what will it serve?
◉ IntelliED provides schools an cost-efficient way of gathering, integrating and managing the entire student data from multiple sources within a single platform.
